In fact, back in 2006, Amazon reported that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckcohn/2015/05/15/a-beginners-guide-to-upselling-and-cross-selling/#7eb08f932912\">35% of its revenues</a> were a direct result of its cross sales and upsells. It is also a lot easier to sell to existing customers than to start from scratch with new customers and offering the right upsell at the right time can even earn customer loyalty.

Cross-sell?</h3>\n<p>Before we go too much further, we need to define what upsells and cross-sells are and the difference between them. <em>Upselling</em> is the practice of encouraging customers to purchase a comparable <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">higher end</span> product than another, while <em>cross-</em><em>selling</em> <!--more--></p>\n<p>invites customers to buy <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">related</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">complementary</span> items. For example, if you suggest to a customer who just bought a new phone to also receive a case, that is a <b>cross</b>&#x2013;<b>sell</b>.&#xA0;<b>Upselling</b> when the seller encourages the customer to spend more than they had originally intended, i.e. add-ons, packages, plans, etc.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7454\" style=\"width: 497px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.fourthwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/upsell.gif\"><div class=\" gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:62.5%\"/><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/590fc/upsell.webp 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/62780/upsell.webp 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/5e02d/upsell.webp 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\"/><source srcSet=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/85a4c/upsell.gif 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/6e0e5/upsell.gif 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" srcSet=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/85a4c/upsell.gif 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/6e0e5/upsell.gif 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif 487w\" src=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif\" alt=\"Upsell Example\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/590fc/upsell.webp 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/62780/upsell.webp 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/5e02d/upsell.webp 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\"/><source srcset=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/85a4c/upsell.gif 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/6e0e5/upsell.gif 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\"/><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" srcset=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/85a4c/upsell.gif 240w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/6e0e5/upsell.gif 480w,\n/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif 487w\" src=\"/static/c1009587aeeb2b15072a635b59d5a347/ec584/upsell.gif\" alt=\"Upsell Example\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></div></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-7454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of an Upsell</p></div>\n<p>Enough with all the talk about the advantages of upselling and cross-selling &#x2013; in this article we are going to go over how we accomplished implementing a cross-sell feature in Netsuite within the customer&#x2019;s cart, and product detail pages and the results that came with it.</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>To start with a little background in how this project came up, the customers&#x2019; site in which we were working with had a plethora of small related accessories and products that achieved the same result in a multitude of ways. However, most of these products were previously hidden deep inside specific, narrow categories given the nature of the sites&#x2019; inventory. This was the ideal situation for a cross-sell opportunity, and since we had ample room on the product detail page (PDP) and cart pages, we chose those locations.</p>\n<h3>Manual Related Items</h3>\n<p>We utilized Netsuite&#x2019;s underlying Related records feature. Items can be manual set/selected on inventory/assembly/service items alike. They can also be arranged in order of importance and display for use on product detail and cart pages.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Related Items</h3>\n<p>It would be quite a chore to go through and manually select each related item for EVERY record in your account. Luckily, our solution automatically builds and adds the related records to each item and you can still add, remove, and edit any automatically entered item.</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>With any drastic change to a website&#x2019;s main pages, you can&#xA0;<em>sometimes</em> experience an initial drop-off in existing customers&#x2019; conversion rates and overall order value. This is due in part to them becoming frustrated over &#x201C;change&#x201D; in something that was previously comfortable to use. Thankfully this did not happen in our case, but to further alleviate this potential confounding variables we looked at the average order size a year <strong>before</strong> the cross-sell changes outlined above, and <strong>after</strong> implementing the cross-sell solution. We found that the Avg. Order Value&#xA0;<strong>increased by 11.29%</strong>! I believe we can chalk that up in the win category.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7456\" style=\"width: 368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.fourthwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/orderValue.png\"><div class=\" gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:62.5%\"/><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/590fc/orderValue.webp 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/1b3c9/orderValue.webp 358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"/><source srcSet=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/8f8e9/orderValue.png 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png 358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\" srcSet=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/8f8e9/orderValue.png 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png 358w\" src=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png\" alt=\"Average Order Value Increase\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/590fc/orderValue.webp 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/1b3c9/orderValue.webp 358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"/><source srcset=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/8f8e9/orderValue.png 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png 358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"/><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\" srcset=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/8f8e9/orderValue.png 240w,\n/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png 358w\" src=\"/static/a21a92425254737b248ad3daaf2488a7/64d95/orderValue.png\" alt=\"Average Order Value Increase\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></div></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-7456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Average Order Value Increase</p></div>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>If you have never thought about using upselling or cross-selling as a way to improve your company&#x2019;s revenue, then what better time than now to start that initiative. Analytically speaking, upselling is more effective than cross-selling in terms of generating more revenue. However, it is not always practical to upsell given the product at hand being sold. There are cases when cross-selling makes more sense (like in our situation above), and there are also situations where <em>both</em> methods can be used together.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in which method is best for your application, please do not hesitate to <a href=\"https://www.fourthwc.com/contact-fourth-wave-consulting\">reach out to us</a>.
